### Spectral Features:

- **Spectral Centroid**: Indicates where the center of mass of the spectrum is located.
- **Spectral Bandwidth**: Describes the width of the spectral band.
- **Spectral Contrast**: Measures the level difference between peaks and valleys in the sound spectrum.
- **Spectral Flatness**: Measures how noise-like a sound is, as opposed to being tonal.
- **Spectral Rolloff**: Frequency below which a specified percentage of the total spectral energy lies.

### Tempo Features:

- **Tempo**: The estimated overall tempo of the track in beats per minute (BPM).

### Rhythm Features:

- **Beat Frames and Beat Times**: Locations of beat events.

### Harmonic and Percussive Components:

- **Harmonic and Percussive Signals**: Separation of the harmonic elements and the percussive elements of the audio.

### Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs):

- **MFCCs**: A representation of the short-term power spectrum of sound, often used in speech and music analysis.

### Zero-Crossing Rate:

- **Zero-Crossing Rate**: The rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.

### Root Mean Square Energy:

- **RMS Energy**: The square root of the average power of the signal.

### Chroma Feature:

- **Chroma STFT**: Projects the spectrum onto 12 bins representing the 12 distinct semitones (or chroma) of the musical octave.
