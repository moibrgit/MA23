## Preprocessing

- [ ] the original file and the noise file should be 44100 Hz,  1 Channcel , 16 bit
- [ ] Calculate the 
- [ ] Check the duration of the original and the noise, if the noise duration more than 25% of the original file, Trim the noise file to be 25% of the original duration
- [ ] add the noise to the original file, so that the noise can start in random position between the begin of the original file and maximum the 60% of the original file
- [ ] Log the prcocess in csv file which should have the following columns (original_filename, noise_filename, target_filename , original_duration, noise_duration, target duration, start_position of noise in seconds, end position of noise in seconds, original file_ sample rate, noise sample rate, target sample rate )
- [ ] All constants should be stored in variables as constants and not hard coded
- [ ] Write the code in functions-wise
- [ ] Use Pathlib and Logging module and use logging.info to trace the functions
